This section lists the required modules for running the code. Download and place them either in the same directory as your Python script or in a new folder on your PC, from which you can then run the script.
There are several ways to manage these modules, so choose whatever best suits you.
Example of how to run the code using the modules or without them  can be found in the Notebooks folder
